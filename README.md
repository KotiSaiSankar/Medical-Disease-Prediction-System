## 📌 Usage
1️⃣ **Run the application using Streamlit:**
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

2️⃣ **Interact with the Web App:**
- Select a disease from the dropdown menu.
- Enter the required medical details.
- Click the **Predict** button.
- Get an instant result: **"Positive" or "Negative" diagnosis**.

## 📊 Results
This system uses trained ML models to provide **accurate predictions** based on various medical parameters:

✔ **Diabetes Prediction**: Uses glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.
✔ **Heart Disease Prediction**: Analyzes blood pressure, cholesterol, and other risk factors.
✔ **Parkinson’s Disease Prediction**: Detects voice-related changes.
✔ **Lung Cancer Prediction**: Evaluates symptoms like smoking history, wheezing, and coughing.
✔ **Hypo-Thyroid Prediction**: Analyzes hormone levels.

Each prediction is displayed in an easy-to-understand format for quick analysis.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
🚀 Add more disease predictions using ML/Deep Learning.
🎨 Improve UI/UX for a better user experience.
☁ Deploy the application to **AWS/GCP/Heroku**.
📊 Integrate more advanced **data visualization** tools.
